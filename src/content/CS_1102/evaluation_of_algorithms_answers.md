## 2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation by computational complexity (p-84)

1.  _What is computational complexity?_
    - A measure for clarifying how much time and memory area a particular algorithm uses.
2.  _How is computational complexity expressed?_
    - In Big O notation

### (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; Types of computational complexity (p-84)

1. _What are the two types of computational complexity?_
   - Space complexity
   - Time complexity
2. _Define time complexity._
   - How much time an algorithm needs
3. _Define space complexity._
   - How much (memory space) area an algorithm needs

### (2) &nbsp;&nbsp; Computation example (p-84)

1. _Linear search (sequential search) time complexity (number of comparisons)_
   - _Best case/ minimum_ O(1)
   - _Average case_ O(n)
   - _Worst case/ maximum_ O(n)
1. _Binary search time complexity (number of comparisons)_
   - _Best case/ minimum_ O(n)
   - _Average case_ O(n<sup>2</sup>)
   - _Worst case/ maximum_ O(n<sup>2</sup>)
   <!-- 2. _What are the minimum, average, and maximum number of times of comparisons (best case, average case, worst case complexities) for binary search algorithm?_
   - O(n)
   - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
   - O(n<sup>2</sup>) -->

## 2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation by validity (p-85)

1. _Name and define the three types of validity?_
   - Partial validity (whether segments satisfy specifications or not)
   - Terminability validity (whether a program can terminate or not. Infinite loops must not occur)
   - Total validity (whether the whole program satisfy specifications or not)

## 2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation by representation (p-85)

1. _Give two examples of evaluation by representation._
   - Using functions for repeatedly executing steps
   - Increasing the processing speed
