## 2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Character string processing (p-49)

1. _What are two types of character string processing?_
   - Character string search
   - Character string compression

### (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; Character string search (p-49)

1. _What are two methods of character string search?_

   - Simple collation method
   - Boyer-Moore method

2. _How does simple collaton method work?_

   - Text is compared character by character from the head and when the character string being searched is found, its position is set as the return value.

3. _Does simple collation method perform the search from the head or from the tail?_

   - From the head

4. _How does Boyer-Moore method work?_

   - Data is collated while the characters in the text are skipped.

5. _Does Boyer-Moore method perform the search from the head or from the tail?_
   - From the tail

### (2) &nbsp;&nbsp; Character string compression (p-52)

1. _What is character string compression?_

   - Making character strings short by replacing consecutive characters or blanks with the number of characters.

<br>

   - Updating files
   - Maintaining files

<br>

## 2.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing figures (p-61)
